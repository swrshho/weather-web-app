my code along project with vertex computer science academy course

Hello Everyone!

this repo is my code along javascript weather web application project with vertex computer science academy's modern javascript course.

this is NOT a copy and paste! i actually wrote it line by line and went through any line that i did't understood and learned that subject.
this project was the most enjoyable project i ever did! because i leaned so much by doing it.
at first learning to work with APIs and asynchronous javascript seemed like a big step for me.
i did struggle with fetch and async/await at first but by giving it time and going through it over and over i finally could understand it.
and it was not just the fetch and async/await, because in order to learn them i had to learn promises and in order to learn that i had to learn callbacks.
so it was a pretty good education on asynchronous javascript. and also learning about APIs and working JSON objects was so much fun!
and i learned the arrow function syntax and now i love it! it's such a sugary syntax!

also the layout is pretty a simple flexbox, nothingfancy.

overall i think this project was the best exprience that i had with an online course and it taught so much. so i'd like to thank vertex computer science academy for that.
